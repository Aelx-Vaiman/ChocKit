# ChocKit 

This project includes modifications based on the work of Swiftful Thinking, LLC.
- Original project: https://github.com/SwiftfulThinking/SwiftfulUI

A library of reusable SwiftUI components that are missing from the SwiftUI framework.

- See the SwiftUI Previews within source files for example implementations.

# New 
- ChockKit TabView offers unparalleled customization, allowing you to shape your tab bar's aesthetics precisely to your liking. Whether you prefer a minimalist approach or a burst of colors, CustomTabView empowers you to craft a tab bar that seamlessly aligns with your app's visual identity, effortlessly.

- Experience the seamless integration of ChockKit with SwiftUI's view lifecycle updates. By seamlessly incorporating methods such as `onAppear(perform:)`, `onDisappear(perform:)`, and `task(priority:_:)`, ChockKit ensures that every tab switch triggers these lifecycle events, enriching your app's responsiveness and functionality.

- ChockKit goes the extra mile in preserving your views' state during tab changes. Whether you're juggling multiple tasks across tabs or executing crucial actions, returning to a previously selected tab guarantees finding the view in its precise former state, enhancing user experience.
